# Parade Presentation Software

Parade is a Sinatra web app that reads serves up markdown files in a
presentation format. Parade can serve a directory or be configured to run with
a simple configuration file.

## Comparison Vs PowerPoint / Keynote

Parade is easily out-done by professional presentation software packages as
far as out-of-the-box style and design. However, there are benefits that
Parade has over presentational software:

### The Good

* Markdown backed data

    > This ultimately makes it easier to manage diffs when making changes,
    using the content in other documents, and quickly re-using portions of a
    presentation.

* Syntax Highlighting

    > Using GitHub flavored markdown, code fences will automatically be
    syntax highlighted making it incredibly easy to integrate code samples

* Code Execution

    > Slides are able to provide execution and show results for javascript,
    Coffeescript, and Ruby live within the browser. Allowing for live
    demonstrations of code.

* Web

    > The system is simply a website which allows for a lot of possibilities

### The Ugly

* Lack of style

    > Most presentation packages are going to provide for you better templates

* Speed of Layout and Animation

    > Unless you're skills are great with CSS/Animations, you are likely going
    to have a harder time creating presentations with as much polish.

* Resizing

    > Currently the presentation system can change gradual sizes, but is not
    very capable of growing well to the full resolution of current presentation
    resolution.

# Installation and Usage

```bash
$ gem install parade
```

## Starting the Slide Show

```bash
$ parade
```

By default running parade with start a presentation from the current working
directory. It will find all markdown files, `**/*.md`, within the directory
and create a presentation out of them.

>  By default parade will split slides along lines that start with a single `#`


## Slide Show Commands

You can manage the presentation with the following keys:

> ### *space* or *cursor right*
>
> Advance to the next slide or advance the next incremental bullet point
or show the end result of the code execution.
>
> ### *shift-space* or *cursor left*
>
> Move to the previous slide
>
> ### *z* or *?*
>
> Toggle help
>
> ### *f*
>
> Toggle footer (which shows slide count of total slides, percentage)
>
> ### *d*
>
> Toggle DEBUG information
>
> ### *c* or *t*
>
> Toggle the display of the Table of Contents
>
> ### *p*
>
> Toggle pre-show


### Serving a specific directory

```bash
$ parade [directory]
```

This will start a presentation from the specified directory. Again, finding all
markdown files contained within the directories or sub-directories.

### Serving specific files

To include certain files, specify an order, duplicate slides, you will need to
define a `parade` file. Within that file, you may define specific files,
specific folders, and the order of the presentation.

```ruby
title "My Presentation"
slides "intro.md"
section "directory_name"
```

> **slides** and **section** are exactly the same, however you may choose to
  use one over the other depending of you are mentioning a specific file of
  slides or a directory which could contain another `parade` or be considered
  a section.

You can so define sub sections with a title and slides or additional sections.

```ruby

title "My Presentation"

section "Introduction" do
  slides "intro.md"
end

section "Code Samples" do
  slides "ruby"
  slides "javascript"
  section "coffeescript"
end
```

# Slide Format

## Slide Separators

### Separator: **#**

Slides are simply markdown format. As stated previously, slides will be
separated along the `#`elements within your document.

### Separator: !SLIDE

Relying on the `#` as a separator is not always ideal. So you may alternatively
use the `!SLIDE` separator. This also provides you with the ability to define
additional metadata with your slides and presentation.

```markdown
!SLIDE

# My Presentation

!SLIDE bullets incremental transition=fade

# Bullet Points

* first point
* second point
* third point
```

> Using this separator will immediately override `#`, so you will have to
  insert `!SLIDE` separators in all places you would like cut your slides.

## Notes

You can define special notes that are shown in presenter mode.

> Presenter mode has been removed until it can be rebuilt

Add a line that starts with .notes:

```markdown
## Important Slide

* First Thing
* Second Things

.notes The reason that the second thing came about is because things changed.
```

> In this example, the HTML output will contain a `<p class='notes'>`
Toggle presenter notes with the `n` key while in the presentation.

> Presenter mode has been removed until it can be rebuilt

### Metadata

#### HTML IDs

```markdown
!SLIDE #slide-id-1
```

> In this example the id of the slide div would be set to `#slide-id-1`

You can define an ID that will be added to the slide's `div`. This id will be
set to any value prefaced with the `#` character.

#### Transitions

```markdown
!SLIDE transition=fade
```

> In this example, the slide will __fade__ when it is viewed. This will set
  `data-transition='fade'` on the slides's `div`.

You can define transitions from the available body of transitions.

The transitions are provided by jQuery Cycle plugin. See http://www.malsup.com/jquery/cycle/browser.html to view the effects and http://www.malsup.com/jquery/cycle/adv2.html for how to add custom effects.

##### Available Transitions

* none (this is the default)
* blindX, blindY, blindZ
* cover
* curtainX, curtainY
* fade
* fadeZoom
* growX, growY
* scrollUp, scrollDown, scrollLeft, scrollRight
* scrollHorz, scrollVert
* shuffle
* slideX, slideY
* toss
* turnUp, turnDown, turnLeft, turnRight
* uncover
* wipe
* zoom

#### CSS Classes

```markdown
!SLIDE bullets incremental my-custom-css-class
```
> In this example, this will add custom css classes to the slide's `div` will
  display the following classes:
  `class='content bullets incremental my-custom-css-class'`. _Note:_ the content
  class is added by the default slide template.

All remaining single terms are added as css classes to the slide's `div`.

##### Defined Classes

Parade defines a number of special CSS classes:

> ### center
> centers images on a slide
>
> ### full-page
> allows an image to take up the whole slide
>
> ### bullets
> sizes and separates bullets properly (fits up to 5, generally)
>
> ### columns
>
> creates columns for every `##` markdown element in your slides (up to 4)
>
> ### smbullets
> sizes and separates more bullets (smaller, closer together)
>
> ### subsection
> creates a different background for titles
>
> ### command
> monospaces h1 title slides
>
> ### commandline
> for pasted commandline sections (needs leading '$' for commands, then
> output on subsequent lines)
>
> ### code
> monospaces everything on the slide
>
> ### incremental
> can be used with 'bullets' and 'commandline' styles, will incrementally
>  update elements on arrow key rather than switch slides
>
> ### small
> make all slide text 80%
>
> ### smaller
> make all slide text 70%
>
> ### execute
> on Javascript, Coffeescript and Ruby highlighted code slides, you can
> click on the code to execute it and display the results on the slide


# Presentation Customization

## Custom JavaScript

To insert custom JavaScript into your presentation you can either place it into
a file (with extension .js) into the root directory of your presentation or you
can embed a *script* element directly into your slides. This JavaScript will
be executed—as usually—as soon as it is loaded.

If you want to trigger some JavaScript as soon as a certain page is shown or
when you switch to the next or previous slide, you can bind a callback to a
custom event:

> ### parade:show
> will be triggered as soon as you enter a page
> ### parade:next
> will be triggered when you switch to the next page
> ### parade:incr
> will be triggered when you advance to the next increment on the page
> ### parade:prev
> will be triggered when you switch to the previous page

These events are triggered on the "div.content" child of the slide, so you must
add a custom and unique class to your SLIDE to identify it:

```markdown
!SLIDE custom_and_unique_class
# 1st Example h1
<script>
// bind to custom event
$(".custom_and_unique_class").bind("parade:show", function (event) {
  // animate the h1
  var h1 = $(event.target).find("h1");
  h1.delay(500)
    .slideUp(300, function () { $(this).css({textDecoration: "line-through"}); })
    .slideDown(300);
});
</script>
```

This will bind an event handler for *parade:show* to your slide. The
h1-element will be animated, as soon as this event is triggered on that slide.

If you bind an event handler to the custom events *parade:next* or
*parade:prev*, you can prevent the default action (that is switching to the
appropriate slide) by calling *event.preventDefault()*:

```markdown
!SLIDE prevent_default
# 2nd Example h1
<script>
$(".prevent_default").bind("parade:next", function (event) {
  var h1 = $(event.target).find("h1");
  if (h1.css("text-decoration") === "none") {
    event.preventDefault();
    h1.css({textDecoration: "line-through"})
  }
});
</script>
```

This will bind an event handler for *parade:next* to your slide. When you press
the right arrow key the first time, the h1-element will be decorated. When you
press the right array key another time, you will switch to the next slide.

The same applies to the *parade:prev* event, of course.

## Custom Stylesheets

To insert custom Stylesheets into your presentation you can either place it into
a file (with extension .css) into the root directory of your presentation or
you can embed a *link* element directly into your slides. This stylesheet will
be applied as soon as it is loaded.

The content generated by the slide is wrapped with a *div* with the class .+content+ like this.

```html
<div class="content">
<h1>jQuery &amp; Sinatra</h1>
<h2>A Classy Combination</h2>
</div>
```

This makes the .*content* tag a perfect place to add additional styling if that
is your preference. An example of adding some styling is here.

```css
.content {
  color: black;
  font-family: helvetica, arial;
}
h1, h2 {
  color: rgb(79, 180, 226);
  font-family: Georgia;
}
.content::after {
  position: absolute;
  right: 120px;
  bottom: 120px;
  content: url(jay_small.png);
}
```

Note that the example above uses CSS3 styling with ::*after* and the *content*
-attribute to add an image to the slides.


# Command Line Interface

```bash
parade command_name [command-specific options] [--] arguments...
```

* Use the command __help__ to get a summary of commands
* Use the command `help command_name` to get a help for _command_name_
* Use `--` to stop command line argument processing; useful if your arguments have dashes in them

## parade help [command]

Shows list of commands or help for one command

## parade generate presentation

Create new parade presentation

This command helps start a new parade presentation by setting up the proper directory structure for you.  It takes the directory name you would like parade to create for you.

> ### Options
>
> dir:"directory_name" - the name of the directory you want to generate the
>   presentation (defaults to *presentation*)
>
> title:"Presentation Title" - the title of the presentation
>
> description:"Presentation Description" - a description of the presentation

## parade generate outline

Create new parade outline file

Within the existing directory create a **parade** file that contains some
sample sections and slide references to get you started with creating
your customized presentation.

> ### Options
>
> title:"Presentation Title" - the title of the presentation
>
> description:"Presentation Description" - a description of the presentation
>
> outline:"custom outline filename" - if you want to specify a custom outline
>   filename (i.e. override the default **parade** filename).

## parade generate rackup

Create new rackup file

Within the existing directory create a **config.ru** file that contains the
default code necessary to serve this code on Heroku and other destinations.

## parade server

Serves the parade presentation in the current directory

> ### Options
>
> These options are specified *after* the command.
>
> *-f, --file=arg* Presentation file (default: *parade*)
>
> *-h, --host=arg* Host or IP to serve on (default *localhost*)
>
> *-p, --port=arg* The port to serve one (default: *9090*)
>
> ### Aliases
>
> parade s
>
> parade serve

# Future Plans

I really want this to evolve into a dynamic presentation software server,
that gives the audience a lot of interaction into the presentation -
helping them decide dynamically what the content of the presentation is,
ask questions without interrupting the presenter, etc.  I want the audience
to be able to download a dynamically generated PDF of either the actual
talk that was given, or all the available slides, plus supplementary
material. And I want the presenter (me) to be able to push each
presentation to Heroku or GitHub pages for archiving super easily.


## Presenter Tools

* simple highlighting (highlight region of slide / click to highlight)
* timer (time left, percent done, percent time done)
* editing slides
* preview
* let you write on the slide with your mouse, madden-style via canvas

## Presentation Layout

* theme support
* squeeze-to-fit style
* simple animations (image from A to B)
* show a timer - elapsed / remaining
* perform simple animations of images moving between keyframes
* automatically resize text to fit screen [see Alex's shrink.js]

## Output Formats

* pdf with notes
* webpage
* let audience members download slides, code samples or other supplementary
  material

## Clean up

* More modularity with presentation filters and renderers to allow presenters
  to create custom ones for the particular slide show
* Modular approach to features
* Clean up Javascript

## Interaction

* questions / comments system
* audience vote-based presentation builder, results live view
* show audience questions / comments (twitter or direct)
* let audience members go back / catch up as you talk
* let audience members vote on sections (?)

## Platforms

* show synchronized, hidden notes on another browser (like an iphone)
* broadcast itself on Bonjour
